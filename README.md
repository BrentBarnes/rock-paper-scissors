# rock-paper-scissors

This project helped me and taught me a lot! I feel like it was an accurate culmination of everything we've learned so far. 

I had issues because I wasn't paying the utmost attention when reading the learning articles. This led to much frustration when it came to undefined variables that were out of scope, and not knowing when I was declaring or calling functions. I reached out to The Odin Project discord for the first time during this project, and a very nice person helped me. While he didn't lead me to the answer, he suggested that I go back to the readings because he could sense some lack of fundamental understanding. Low and behold, I went back to the readings and watched a few YouTube videos about function and scope, and I was off to the races again! I came back after that, and I was able to finish the project and it felt great!


Key Takeaways!

1. Unless it's being declared for the first time, functions will always be called when using parenthesis, even when they are being stored in a variable.

2. If you declare a variable, it must be used in the scope or else it will say it's been declared, but is never read.

3. A function MUST return something in most situations. Don't forget to add a return value!

4. If you pass a function as an argument to another function. You must execute that function inside of the new function, and you probably want to then store that returned value inside of a new variable so that it can be used throughout the new function.

5. Make sure you understand what logical operators are really doing.

6. Use a whiteboard to track flow of program.
